  "summary": "Build EchoShift, a real-time multiplayer party chat web app (MVP) for 3–6 players with anonymous usernames, room codes, lobby, role assignment, a pre-chat topic voting screen, chat gameplay with timer, a post-chat Guessing screen where only the Anchor can multi-select non-Anchor players via checkboxes and submit a guess, saving per-player correctness results to the database, then transitioning everyone to Results—no login, minimal modern responsive UI.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "MVP scope: no power cards yet.",
    "Realtime backend should use Firebase or Supabase for room state + chat messages.",
    "No authentication: players use auto-generated anonymous usernames and join via room code.",
    "Extend the room/player data model to include a per-player 'role' field (string, default \"\") stored in the backend room state.",
    "Start Game scope update: after setting exactly one player.role = \"Anchor\", assign every other player.role to a random value from: Overly Dramatic, Suspicious, Motivational, Alien, Villain, Emotional, Reporter, Conspiracy; persist roles; do not modify any other room/player fields.",
    "Chat UI must display only the current player's own role (never other players' roles); if role == \"Anchor\" show: \"You are the Anchor. Observe carefully.\" else show: \"Your Personality: [role name]\".",
    "Add a Topic Selection phase/screen before Chat: after roles assigned, generate 3 random topics from the provided fixed list, collect one vote per player, end when all voted or after 20 seconds, choose topic with most votes, persist selected topic in room state, then transition all players to Chat; Chat UI shows selected topic at top.",
    "Chat phase requires a room-synced 180s countdown timer that starts when Chat begins; when it expires, disable chat input and advance room phase to Guessing for all players.",
    "Guessing phase update: after Chat timer ends, transition to a Guessing screen where only the Anchor can select any number of non-Anchor players (checkbox list) and submit; on submit, compute correctness by comparing selections vs each player's actual role, persist guess + per-player correct/incorrect results in room state/database, then advance all players to Results.",
    "Results/Scoring rules: On Results, reveal roles (Anchor shown as \"Anchor\"; others show their Personality Card/role). Highlight which non-Anchor players were guessed correctly by the Anchor. Award points: Anchor gets +1 per correctly guessed non-Anchor; each non-Anchor gets +1 if the Anchor did NOT guess them. Show a summary message (e.g., \"Anchor guessed X/Y correctly!\" and per-player survival message) and provide a \"Play Again\" action that returns the room to Lobby for a new round (clean, readable UI with soft rounded cards)."
